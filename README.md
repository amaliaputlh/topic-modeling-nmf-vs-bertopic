üß¥ Skincare Reviews Topic Modeling (NMF vs BERTopic)

üìñ Description
This repository contains an implementation and comparison of two topic modeling methods: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and BERTopic, applied to Indonesian skincare product reviews. The project includes topic modeling, evaluation (coherence & diversity), and an interactive Streamlit application for exploring results.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing, stopword removal, stemming, etc.) was conducted separately in Jupyter Notebook. The final preprocessed dataset is saved as CSV and used as input in this project. The preprocessing notebook is included in the preprocessing/ folder for reference.

üéØ Objectives
- Apply unsupervised topic modeling on skincare reviews.
- Compare the performance of NMF and BERTopic.
- Evaluate models using coherence and topic diversity.
- Provide interactive visualization through a Streamlit app.

üìä Dataset
- Source: Reviews of skincare products from Female Daily.
- Size: ~2000 reviews.
- Language: Indonesian.
- Format: Preprocessed CSV
